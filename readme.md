# Assignment 1: WordPress Site Setup 

### WordPress Architecture 

This is a what I learned

<p> When it comes to WordPress Architecture, I didnt know that WordPress used many components such as PHP, SQL, HTML,CSS, and JavaScript.
 I also didnt know that WordPress can be used for different areas like blogs, E-Commerce stores, and business.
 I look forward to diving more into WordPress throughout the semester </p>

### WordPress site Setup 

<p> Regarding the WordPress Site Setup, I thought the process was simple for someone who was not familiar with the term "WordPress" or what it is prior to the first day.
 I'm not the most experience user when it comes to using markdown. However, I am open to learn more about it as the semester progresses! </p>
